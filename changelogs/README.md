#### The next update features 3 new maps: `Heavens`, `Scorched`, and `Mystics`, changes in HP additions in `Heal`, and several buffs and nerfs.

*`R: Confusion`* - Stun prompt now returns damage.

--•-- (3 - 16 DMG)

___

### • `Buffs`:
*`Q: Solid Punch`* - Solid punch now deals more damage, it is now SOLID.

--•-- 21 Max. DMG -> 25 Max. DMG

*`R: Confusion`* - Stun & Non-stun are no longer identical. Stun means less damage taken.

--•-- 16 Max. DMG (Non-stun) -> 18 Max. DMG

•*`Q: Heartstealer`* - Increases lifesteal, because it's lifesteal.

--•-- 3 HP -> 5 HP

--•-- Caster Damage: 23 DMG -> 26 DMG

--•-- Enemy Damage: 25 DMG -> 23 DMG

•*`R: Double Shot`* - This OP action will be nerfed. Seriously, all you need to do is to increase your faith and the guy's dead within 4 bullets.

___

### • `New`:
•*`Heavens`* - The call of the heavens, the purifier of all corrupted.

Actions: `Q: Hammer of Guilt` | `W: Destiny` | `E: Redemption` | `R: Spark!`

•*`Scorched`* - A former land of forge, being destroyed by the land invaders and sets the entire town on fire. The problem is, the fire never stops and all trapped inside gained powers and immunity enough to survive the fiery town.

Actions: `Q: Infernal Chains` | `W: Ignite` | `E: Fiery Pillar` | `R: Fireball`

•*`Mystics`* - Also called the Mystical Garden, is home to ascended goddesses, and blooms. Handled by Loriatone, this garden is called the Forbidden Garden due to its fatal to mortals/ordinary humans.

Actions: `Q: Soul Drain` | `W: Vineroot` | `E: Thunderbolt` | `R: Acid Rain`
