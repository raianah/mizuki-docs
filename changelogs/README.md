___

### • `Buffs`:

• N/A

___

### • `Nerfs`:

•*`R: Double Shot`* - Past patch this was also nerfed, so I'll nerf this one more because it is still strong enough to two-shot a 30 HP guy.

--•-- First Shot: 6/17 DMG -> 4/12 DMG

--•-- Second Shot: 5/15 DMG -> 5/13 DMG

•*`W: Double Kick`* - Kicks aren't that painful, so I'll tinker the damage down.

--•-- First Shot: 6/19 DMG -> 3/12 DMG

--•-- Second Shot: 9/21 DMG -> 4/15 DMG

### • `New`:

•*`Spirit Shrine`* - Awakened and reformed by The Arcane, this now serves as the shelter for wandering souls, both loving and unloving.

Actions: `Q: Mass Destruction` | `W: Shattered Soul` | `E: Fragments of Soul` | `R: Burning Mist`

•*`Oasis Temple`* - Rich in cultured artifacts, and cursed beings, this temple has been there for centuries, waiting for someone to enter and feed into its curse.

Actions: `Q: Sharp Edge` | `W: Cursed Artifact` | `E: Scavenge` | `R: Sand Blow`

•*`Arcane Stadia`* - A fast-paced arena with stacking damages to one-shot everything through a 4-hit 'W'
