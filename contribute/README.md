Welcome to the Collaborative Community Creators, where everyone can express their skills to improve Porcopion and become part of the collaboration. Currently Porcopion's
Collaborative Program is accepting the following:

- New Topics, WYR's, PTB's
- Battle Maps/Arenas
- Event Storyline
  - To gain idea of how the story flows, read the lore at the [documentation](https://raianah.gitbook.io/porcopion/others/maps#map-lists).

Soon we are opening contributions for:

- Local Translations
- Landscape Arts and/or Character Sprites (Pixel Arts)
- and more...

<h2>How to Contribute?</h2>

followed by your entry in text form, .txt form, .docs/.pdf form, as long as it is readable and can support both latin and non-latin characters, unicodes and emojis.

<h2>Text Formats</h2>
If you are using `.txt` format, please do the following:

- In Notepad or any text editor, emphasize the title of what are you contributing to:
  - \*\*TOPIC\*\* followed by your entry.
- This is so helpful if you are doing multiple entries in different sectors, for better readability.

In the end it should be like this:
```
**TOPIC**

Your entries here.

**EVENT STORYLINE**
Your story here.
```

If you are using Microsoft Word or any text editor that supports `.docx` file, emphasize the title by using **bold**. No fonts are required as long as its simple and readable.
