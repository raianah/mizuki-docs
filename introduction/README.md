Hello! I am Mizuki Amatari, one among the said chosens. I wield the power of the late Twilight.

This repository contains some fragments from [Mizuki](https://github.com/raianah/twlight-docs "Github Link"). The main repository is not available for public. This bot is coded by `μ°¨λ―Έν† #0718 (raianah)`, and by `[redacted]` for additional commits and small updates.
